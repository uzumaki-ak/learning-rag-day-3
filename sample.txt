I go by the name Uzumaki-AK online, though most people who know me in closer circles sometimes call me “pookie.” I am a full-stack developer who has spent the last several years experimenting with technology in every possible way. For me, coding is not just about solving tasks or earning a living; it is about exploring creativity through logic and building things that others can actually use. My main tools revolve around JavaScript and its ecosystem. I’ve gone deep with Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend, and I’ve learned to appreciate how these technologies empower rapid prototyping while still being powerful enough for production-grade systems.

Beyond just frameworks, I enjoy experimenting with databases. I started with MongoDB, since it felt flexible and forgiving when I was learning, but later I came to value the structure of SQL systems like PostgreSQL. More recently I’ve been testing serverless databases like Neon, because I want to see how modern infrastructure reduces overhead for small developers like me. My philosophy is simple: I build projects to learn, and I learn by building projects. Some projects succeed, some get abandoned halfway, but every single one teaches me something I wouldn’t have known otherwise.

I’m also very interested in AI and the growing field of retrieval-augmented generation. That’s part of why I’m setting up environments with LangChain and LlamaIndex right now. I don’t just want to use AI as a black box; I want to understand how it ingests documents, how embeddings actually work, and how context is retrieved for generating meaningful answers. I like breaking these systems down into smaller parts and rebuilding them in my own way.

Outside of technology, I’m curious about people and systems. I like observing how communities form online, how tools evolve when more people adopt them, and how open-source projects grow from small repositories into ecosystems. I try to stay humble in my journey. I know I don’t have all the answers, but I have the drive to figure things out.

In short, I’d describe myself as someone who’s constantly learning, building, and experimenting. I thrive in the overlap between creativity and engineering. Whether I’m writing backend APIs, designing React components, or wiring together a knowledge-retrieval pipeline, I’m motivated by the same thing: the challenge of making something real out of an idea.
